# tan3li UI Component Library

Collection of tan3li UI components and some general documentation.

This Storybook is up-to-date with main-branch of [tan3li-ui-components](https://github.com/Visma-tan3li/tan3li-ui-components) repository. Release version content may be behind.

## Getting started

As this library is private, getting it up and running requires some extra steps.

### Access token

Installation requires GitHub personal access token assigned to NPM_TOKEN environment variable.

1. Go to GitHub Setting > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic) > Generate new token (classic)
2. Give the token some name, f.e. "GitHub packages" and expiration date, and give it at least `read:packages` rights. If you're planning to release packages, `write:packages` rights could be also given.
3. Create the token and make sure to copy-paste it somewhere (f.e. 1Password) as you can see it only once.
4. Configure token to use SSO by clicking "Configure SSO" and select Visma tan3li.
5. On Windows search for "env" and select "Edit the system environment variables" or similar.
6. In the opened dialog click "Environment variables..." and add new user variable called NPM_TOKEN and give the GitHub token as a value.
7. Restart your computer.
8. Set up `.yarnrc.yml` or `.npmrc` file in your project root to use your NPM_TOKEN.

`.yarnrc.yml`

```yaml
npmScopes:
    visma-tan3li:
        npmAlwaysAuth: true
        npmAuthToken: '${NPM_TOKEN-unset}'
        npmRegistryServer: 'https://npm.pkg.github.com'
```

`.npmrc`

```text
@visma-tan3li:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}
```

### Installation

If you have set NPM_TOKEN environment variable with valid token, you can install the package via `yarn`:

```shell
yarn add @visma-tan3li/tan3li-ui-components@x.y.z
```

or `npm`

```shell
npm install @visma-tan3li/tan3li-ui-components@x.y.z
```

where `x.y.z` is the version you want to install.

### Usage

Styling for components is provided via CSS file which can be included in your project. For example, if using Sass/SCSS,
you can import the CSS file from the package like this:

```scss
@import '@visma-tan3li/tan3li-ui-components/dist/index.css';
```

Components use Inter and Ubuntu fonts. Include them by embedding the following code within the `<head>` of your HTML document.

```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com" />
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin />
<link
    href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;600&family=Ubuntu:wght@500;700&display=swap"
    rel="stylesheet" />
```

Next, you can import any component and start playing around.

```jsx
import {Button, ButtonStyle, ButtonVariant} from '@visma-tan3li/tan3li-ui-components';

export function MyButton() {
    return (
        <Button style={ButtonStyle.Fill} variant={ButtonVariant.Neutral}>
            Click me
        </Button>
    );
}
```

### Internationalization

Many components in this library use built-in strings. These string expect to be translated with `i18next` so you need to provide i18n-instance via `I18nextProvider`.
Library provides english `translation.json` file which can be used as needed when configuring your i18-instance.

Additionally, date & time related components need information about culture (= formatting of date & time), language to use for months, weekdays etc. and timezone.
These locales and timezone can be provided via `I18nProvider`.

In the end, you should set up your app something like this:

```jsx
import {I18nextProvider, initReactI18next} from 'react-i18next';
import {I18nProvider} from '@visma-tan3li/tan3li-ui-components';
import i18n from 'i18next';

i18n.use(initReactI18next).init({
    /* Your i18next options */
});

export function MyApp() {
    return (
        <I18nextProvider i18n={i18n}>
            <I18nProvider cultureLocale="fi-FI" languageLocale="en-GB" timeZone="Europe/Helsinki">
                {/* Your app using library components */}
            </I18nProvider>
        </I18nextProvider>
    );
}
```

### Design tokens

Design tokens live in their own package [tan3li-design-tokens](https://github.com/Visma-tan3li/tan3li-design-tokens) which is a dependency of this library. Design tokens package provides

- All design tokens in CSS format
- All design tokens in JS/TS format
- Breakpoint tokens in SCSS format

CSS tokens are included in the CSS file provided by this library, so you don't have to import them separately in your CSS.
However, it's recommended to install design tokens package alongside component library, so you can use the tokens in your JS/TS code
and utilize SCSS breakpoint tokens in your media queries.
