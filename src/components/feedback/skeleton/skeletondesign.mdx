### Usage

> Skeleton states are wireframe-like versions of components used on an **initial page load** to indicate that the information on the page has not fully loaded yet. They should only appear for only a few seconds, disappearing once components and content populate the page. They help to decrease perceived wait times.

#### Anatomy

A skeleton component is made of a container and a color fill that pulsates at an interval. Both are required to complete a skeleton.

#### When to use

| Where      | When                                                      |
| :--------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| Product UI | when content is being loaded for the first time to the UI |
| Component  | when you know the amount of items to load                 |
| Data Table | when extra load time is expected                          |

#### Behavior

<img src="/images/skeleton/SkeletonBehaviorSuccess.jpg" alt="Successfull loading after Skeleton" />
Skeletons appear on the screen before content loads for the first time, briefly shimmer to indicate activity, and then
disappear once content is available.

<img src="/images/skeleton/SkeletonBehaviorFailure.jpg" alt="Failure in loading after Skeleton" />
If content fails to load, an error message appears. The component used for the error message can vary depending on the
context.

#### Build options

<img src="/images/skeleton/SkeletonBuiltIn.jpg" alt="Example of Skeleton built in" />
All relevant components from Sera DS will gradually include a Skeleton mode.

<img src="/images/skeleton/SkeletonCustom.jpg" alt="Example of Skeleton custom by design system adopters" />
Create your own Skeleton to fit your need. This is particularly useful when you've developed custom components. Just
make sure that the animation among Skeleton elements synchronize.

#### Guides

- In most cases, action components i.e buttons do not need to have a skeleton state.
- Never represent toast notifications, overflow menus, dropdown items, modals, and loaders with skeleton states. Elements inside a modal may have a skeleton state, but the modal itself should not.

<FlexLayout direction="row">
    <FlexLayout direction="column" gap={0}>
        <img src="/images/skeleton/Skeleton-Do.jpg" alt="Dos for Skeleton" />
        <Dos>Show a vague presentation of the UI</Dos>
    </FlexLayout>
    <FlexLayout direction="column" gap={0}>
        <img src="/images/skeleton/Skeleton-Dont.jpg" alt="Donts for Skeleton" />
        <Donts>Show action element, & UI element exactly during loading state</Donts>
    </FlexLayout>
</FlexLayout>
